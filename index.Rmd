## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring whether electric vehicle subsidies are actually effective, and how that compares to the effectiveness of carbon taxes and more negative measures in getting people to shift towards EV use. I'm also interested in seeing how whether the political party of the federal or state government is a predictor of environmental government action on the local level.
